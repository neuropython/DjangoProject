## Demo

Deployed on Railway - https://taskmanagementweb.up.railway.app/
On Railway, I used sleep deployment (which means that you can have a database error (because it needs to "wake up")). You will need to wait ~2 sec to wake up the database. THIS IS NOT A BUG. It is like that because sleep deployment won't charge when the website is not used.
